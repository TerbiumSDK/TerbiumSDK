                    This is just and example "Desktop/we experience" site you can delete the entire example folder. This site is only to show that the site is running and was built in less than 10 minutes.

                The example data and styles on this site are just quick css classes for rendering content out
                in a way that looks half way decent and while you can use them for your own stuff keep in mind
                that they are super quick and dirty just so you have something to see when you load up the newly
                created site.
